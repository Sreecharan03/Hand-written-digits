Emotional voice recognition using machine learning and deep learning focuses on identifying human emotions from speech signals. It involves gathering large datasets of labeled voice samples and preprocessing them to remove noise and standardize the input. Key features like MFCCs, pitch, and energy are extracted from the audio data to capture emotional cues. Various machine learning models, including SVM and Random Forest, as well as deep learning techniques like CNNs, RNNs, and LSTMs, are employed to train and classify emotions such as happiness, sadness, or anger. Through continuous optimization and testing, these models are fine-tuned for higher accuracy and deployed in real-time applications, enhancing voice-based systems like virtual assistants.
