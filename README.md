Handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision. Hereâ€™s a detailed description of the process:

Overview
The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each sized at 28x28 pixels. The dataset is divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. This dataset is widely used for training various image processing systems and is a benchmark for evaluating image classification algorithms.
